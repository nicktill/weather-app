# Weather App [WIP]

This is a weather app that takes in a location input and retrieves weather data using an API. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the weather app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the app is loaded, type in the location you want to get weather data for and press the "Get Weather" button. The app will then retrieve weather data for the specified location and display it on the page.

## API

The weather data is retrieved using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). You will need to sign up for a free account to obtain an API key. Once you have an API key, replace the placeholder value in the `config.js` file with your actual API key.

## Folder Structure

- `css/style.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the app.
- `js/config.js`: Contains the API key for OpenWeatherMap.
- `js/main.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for retrieving weather data and updating the UI.
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the app.
- `README.md`: Contains the documentation for the app.
